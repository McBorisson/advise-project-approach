# Changelog

## 0.3.0 - 2026-06-01

- Added pricing and operating-cost analysis for managed services, hosting, storage, auth, AI APIs, observability, and vendor lock-in.
- Added explicit "free to start is not cheap to operate" safeguards for stack and vendor recommendations.
- Made tradeoffs more aggressive: what you gain, what you give up, what becomes harder later, and when the recommendation becomes wrong.
- Added vendor-agnostic README guidance for copying `SKILL.md` into non-Claude/non-Codex agent harnesses.
- Added a pricing-focused example showing how generic "use Supabase" advice should be challenged.

## 0.2.0 - 2026-05-30

- Added A/B comparison examples showing where the skill should change generic AI advice.
